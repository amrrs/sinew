# Quick Turn Around

Two common scenarios in package development 

  - You start a new project and open a file to develop your idea. Many functions later at the end of the day you look up and you have created a mess of a file.

  - You recieve a mammoth 10,000 line uncommented file to decipher for QC - good luck.

Sinew can help turn the around that headache into a CRAN ready package in a few short steps

  1. Open a package project in Rstudio
  2. Place the file in the project root
  3. Run `untangle` on the large script with the destination directory `./R`. This will separate the core functions in the body into single function files (named as the function) and keep the body in `body.R`. 
  4. Run `pretty_namespace` to append any missing namespaces in the function scripts.
  5. Run `makeOxyFile` with the path set to `./R`.
  6. Run `makeImport` to create the correct `Imports` in the `DESCRIPTION` file and paste it in the the DESCRIPTION file. 
  
This should get you far enough to make the impossible problem of understanding what is in that file to a manageable task, with the added benefit of producing a new package ready for distribution.
